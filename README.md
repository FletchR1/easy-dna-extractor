## Motivation

DNA analysis services like **MyHeritage** charge **$19** for health reports, and other platforms have their own (often higher) pricing tiers. I wanted to create a **free alternative** that anyone can use without paying these fees.

## Supported DNA Data Format

- 23andMe
- MyHeritage
- FamilyTreeDNA
- LivingDNA
- AncestryDNA

##  Disclaimer

I don't have deep expertise in genetics or bioinformatics. This tool is built based on publicly available SNP research and databases.

**If you notice any mistakes or inaccuracies:**
- Please open an issue to let me know
- Or submit a Pull Request to fix it

I appreciate any corrections from people with more knowledge in this field!
